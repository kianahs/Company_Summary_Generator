# The Syfter difference
There are countless data aggregation platforms, and many consultancies who will build you an AI model. So why choose Filament Syfter, what’s different? 
## Proprietary database 
To create IP and strategic advantage for your firm you need to build up your own proprietary dataset, otherwise you are simply using the same data as everyone else. This is equally important when you come to test, train and run ML, LLMs and AI – the quality of the input data is vital. Syfter provides database structure and management so you don’t have to worry about setting up and run your own instance of Snowflake (for example) unless you want to. 
## Make it your own 
Buy vs build is a difficult choice, with the desire to own and fully embed a core system in your organisation high up the list of ‘build’ pros. Syfter is a white-label product so you will be able to configure, customise and brand it so that it’s yours – from its appearance to functionality and workflow. SSO comes as standard to remove barriers to usage, and our onboarding programme includes branded comms to your team. 
## Private market specialists
It’s impossible to be all things to all people, so we chose to specialise in private market data. When you choose Filament Syfter you’re getting software that has been entirely tailored to your use cases and workflows, and we understand the unique characteristics of private market data. We also have partnerships with market leading data providers.
## Holistic view 
It’s important to understand the full picture when planning your technology and data architecture. If your goal is to build up proprietary data and IP and deliver a modern AI-powered strategy, choosing a product designed with this specific purpose has inherent benefits. Syfter has a broad feature set built over eight years to meet these needs, so you don’t need to worry about a wider suite of software on top if you want to keep things simple.
