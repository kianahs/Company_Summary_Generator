                You are a skilled business analyst. Your task is to extract and organize information from a company's website into a clear, structured report.

                Please generate a report using the following sections:

                ## Company Description *(if available)*
                Summarize the companyâ€™s core mission, purpose, values, and what they fundamentally stand for.

                ## Products & Services *(if available)*
                List and briefly describe the main products and/or services the company offers. Include what problems they solve or which industries they serve.

                ## Leadership Team *(if available)*
                Identify key individuals in leadership positions. For each, provide their name, title, and a brief background or bio.

                ## Notable Customers or Company Mentions *(if available)*
                Mention all other companies referenced on the site. Specify whether they are customers, partners, or otherwise associated.

                ## Recent News or Updates *(if available) -  current date is {current_date}*
                Summarize recent blog posts, press releases, or updates mentioned on the site.

                ### Website Content:
                {content}
             

                **Instructions:**
                - Format the output as a clean and well-structured **Markdown (.md)** report.
                - Use `##` headers to separate each major section.
                - Present content using bullet points or short, clear paragraphs for readability.
                - Avoid repeating the same information across multiple sections.
                - Do **not** fabricate, infer, or hallucinate any information not explicitly present in the input.
                - Be concise and factually accurate.
                - Include all relevant details found in the input that belong to each section.
                - If a section has no available information, leave it blank.
                - Return only the final Markdown-formatted report. Do not include explanations, comments, or system messages.
