# Platform Features
## Syfter, your AI-driven data platform
[ Book A Demo ](https://filament.ai/<https:/filament.ai/book-a-demo/>)
## The buy vs build problem solved 
You want proprietary tech and data to create valuable IP for your firms, but you want to be production ready in months.
Syfter gives you the best of both worlds: your own private instance holding all your firms’ data and intelligence, based on a tried and tested product suite that we’ll configure and customise to match your investment thesis.
## Productionised data pipelines
One-time matching of heterogeneous datasets is tricky, but keeping them refreshed to ensure your team is always working on the best quality information is a major challenge. Syfter provides fully production-ready data pipelines that constantly monitor data quality and status of all your internal and external data.
## Sector models using ML 
Every firm categorises sectors slightly differently, and with Syfter you’ll be able to train our Machine Learning models with your own data to ensure accurate classifications. Our models are flexible, and our ML experts guide you through the process. 
## AI First
Syfter is built with AI at its heart. AI (including Machine Learning and LLMs) is only as good as the data used to train it, and adopting an AI-first approach is the best way to ensure your data architecture will support your AI ambitions.
## Discover similar companies
Finding undiscovered targets that look similar to your existing universe before anyone else is the gold in deal origination. Syfter combines rules logic and Machine Learning in a powerful tool that will provide you with recommendations. Accepting or Rejecting these recommendations feeds the models with even more data with which to improve their accuracy. 
## GenAI tear sheets and notifications 
Artificial Intelligence is used throughout Syfter. You’ll also benefit from the latest GenAI technology in a number of new features available within the platform. AI-generated ‘tear sheets’ source insights from all available data and provide a comprehensive review of a target company, and Syfter’s email notifications include nudges and suggested next actions generated by AI. 
## User interface and end user tools 
If you’re already familiar with popular CRMs and data vendor platforms you’ll have high expectations. Syfter is comparable with these (we work closely with some of the market leaders) so you won’t have to compromise. Our user interface (UI) and tools have been designed specifically to support the analysis of large amounts of data, with powerful filters and intuitive navigation. 
## Bi-directional CRM integration
Syfter provides you with an advanced CRM integration toolkit whether you use Salesforce, Dealcloud or Microsoft Dynamics (or something else). Syfter will improve your CRM by adding new data points to existing data and allows you to push new matches to your criteria as soon as they’re identified. Syfter will also monitor your CRM and learn from data held within it.
